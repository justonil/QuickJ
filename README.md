# QuickJ
### Now you dont need to manually select 2nd vertex to connect vertices
## **Just hover and press J!**

![example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03f5ec9a-adc5-4981-b1c5-ed37f6a1f5f0)

You can control hover radius.

Also by default enabled deselection of other points except hovered one after operation.

This is useful for seamless vertices connection. By this you can select first vertex with not mouse click but with J key.  

But you can disable, if you dont need it or it conflict with something.

**J** key is used by default to replace Blender default one. Can be changed in default Blender Keymap settings - **"Quick Connect Vertex Path"**.
